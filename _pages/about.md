I'm originally trained as an experimental physicist, and have now taken a dive into 
Deep Learning! My goal is to utilize AI to develop resources for people that previously
could only be provided by other people. My current focus is on Natural Language Understanding, 
Reinforcement Learning, and Unsupervised Learning.
