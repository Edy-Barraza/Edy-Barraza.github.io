## Week 4
 
I'll be sharing some wonderful neural network architectures for working with sequences of text! Here they are:
<ul>
    <li> Vanilla Recurrent Neural Net (RNN) </li>
    <li> Gated Recurrent United (GRU) </li>
    <li> Long Term Short Memory (LSTM)</li>
</ul>
Note that GRU's and LSTM's are also RNN's. An RNN is a neural network architecture where the connections between
nodes form a time-dependent sequence. Moreover, an RNN utilizes an internal memory for processing sequences in order
to recognize patterns in the data. GRU's and LSTM's are RNN's with more complicated architectures encoding inductive 
biases, allowing them capture more sophisticated patterns in data. 
 unlike
traditional feed-forward networks,
