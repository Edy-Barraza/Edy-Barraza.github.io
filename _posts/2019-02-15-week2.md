## Week 2 
After kicking this week off, it took some time but I feel that I've got a 
groove I can get with to get things done! I was exposed to a lot of  
new knowledge this week, so let me share with you my friends, 
some of the highlights  of what I enjoyed learning! 
I will organize this for you with the following categories 
<ul>
    <li> Natural Language Processing:Word Embeddings  </li>
    <li> Reinforcement Learning: Multi-Armbed Bandit Problems </li>
    <li> Unsupervised Learning:AutoEncoders, K-Means Clustering </li>
</ul>
Let's get started! 

<h2> Natural Language Processing: Word Embeddings</h2>
My focus for NLP this week was learn vector representations of words.
