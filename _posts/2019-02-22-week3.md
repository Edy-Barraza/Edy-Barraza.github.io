## Week 3
 
I have enjoyed an wonderful breadth of knowledge the past two weeks, and now it's time to refine my plan and focus! 
To accelerate my progression, I will be focusing on Natural Language Processing for at least the next week. Taking in a 
breadth of knowledge provides me with a firm foundation, and having depth of knowledge will allow me to produce 
a significant project. As I acquire this depth of knowledge, I will be able to add to my studies courses that will hopefully 
help me develop a project that explores the boundary of current NLP approaches! I hope to share some exciting new with you all
soon!
